			<p class="text-center"><i>"Shakespeare is a kind of miracle", Tom Stoppard</i></p>
			<br><br>

			<p class="text-center">OUR GRATITUDE</p>
			<p>We are immensely grateful for the incredibly generous help of the following benefactors to ensure the project reached this successful prototype stage: </p>
			<br>

			<p class="text-center"><b>Patrons</b></p>

			<p class="text-center"><i>Mrs Terence Delaney, USA</i></p>

			<p class="text-center"><i>Mr Mirko Ilic, Mirko Ilic Inc., New York </i></p>
			<br><br>

			<p>Besides our hard-working office crew, we would like to thank <i>Mr Erik Anthony Von Lim</i>, a top Microsoft specialist in Asia, who has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help us overcome all manner of technical challenges to make this <i>e</i>-project feasible and create optimal formats for actors, teachers and directors. &nbsp;Any shortcomings at this juncture are on the editorial side, for which the author of this page takes full responsibility as General Editor. </p>

			<p>We are also grateful to <i>Lord and Lady Feversham</i> and <i>Mr. Philp Miles</i> for their generous time in dispensing advice on I.T., business compliance and related matters. </p>

			<p>Finally, our thanks to actors / teachers <i>Mr Paul Holme</i> and <i>Miss Pinky Amador</i> who allowed us to experiment on their students. &nbsp;Miss Amador, a graduate of Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, was Miss Saigon under Sir Nicholas Hytner. </p>
			<br><br>
			<p class="text-center"> "<i>In its bold conception and vast scope <i>Versebuster</i> promises to place at your fingertips arguably the most comprehensive guide on how to deliver Shakespeare that anyone has yet attempted, and this in a user-friendly, digital format ideally suited to modern students of the Bard.  </p>

			<p class="text-center">So much thought has gone into the printable scripts that accompany the digital materials the scripts are, in themselves, work-of arts and a joy to use.</p>

			<p class="text-center">It is a measure of the passion of the editors and actors that have embarked on this Herculean task that I eagerly await the completion of this stupendous endeavour.</i>"</p>

			<p class="text-center">Paul Holme</p>
			<br><br>

			<p>THE NEXT LEVEL</p>
			<p>Now that we have proven in workshops that the Versebuster approach greatly accelerates the ability of actors to lift the words off the page in ways Shakespeare broadly intended, we are focusing on funding to bring the project to full fruition.  This will take 15-20 years to reach, but create a lasting legacy that will benefit future generations of actors, directors and teachers.</p>

			<br>

			<p>WHAT IT COSTS</p>
			<p>The typical Shakespeare play costs US$12,000 to break down into its Versebuster component parts (taking into account staffing and running costs).  These component parts comprise:</p>

			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>the 600 page <i>e</i>Play resource for each play, packed with line-by-line <i>performance</i> information that can be projected on walls in workshops and classrooms, or enjoyed on laptops, iPads, and iPhones</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>a wide variety of printable theatre scripts that each serve a distinct and useful performance purpose</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>the speeches of the play in audio, together, where applicable, with their cue-lines to point up all the performance clues embedded in the text (as shown in the <i>e</i>Play and the more sophisticated scripts we produce)</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>If you share our patrons’ belief that the flame of good Shakespeare-speaking must be kept alive via learning formats that have greater appeal to the modern generation, why not consider adding your name, or your company’s name, to our roll of honour?</p>
			<br>

			<p>MORTAL THREATS TO SHAKESPEARE’S ART-FORM </p>

			<p>As the 400<sup>th</sup> commemoration of Shakespeare’s life and work draws to a close it would seem from all the publicity it engendered worldwide that his future at the heart of Western culture is secure and it would be preposterous to suggest otherwise. &nbsp;While we accept that Shakespeare as <i>literature</i> on the shelves of the Bodleian Library or the Folger Institute is forever assured, on the <i>performance</i> front we are not so confident on a 50-100 year projection. &nbsp;Two seismic cultural forces are at work. &nbsp;In relation to Shakespeare, neither is benign.</p>

			<br>
			<p>GATHERING STORM CLOUDS </p>

			<p><b>Part 1</b></p>

			<p>The first storm-front is gathering in academia and on campuses throughout the Anglosphere.  The dominant PC view now emerging is that a phenomenon such as Shakespeare is the oppressive and unfair product of historic white, male privilege.  Therefore, the argument runs, in the new global village where all cultures are 'equal', Shakespeare should be relegated in the public curriculum, or, better still, dropped altogether to give other cultures 'artistic breathing space'. &nbsp;This was the <span class="blue">argument advanced earlier in 2016 by Yale University students <sup>1</sup></span> and at <span class="blue">a school in California <sup>2</sup></span> (links at end). &nbsp;That this argument is gaining traction among young, non-Caucasians is certainly understandable - sixteenth Elizabethan / Jacobean England must seem very remote to those who are not its descendants. &nbsp;Two things alarm us though.</p>

			<p>First, the protest drew fairly wide support from members of the Yale faculty. &nbsp;There seems here a failure to grasp that Shakespeare's voice is universal because he articulates the human condition. &nbsp;The human condition is independent of colour, race, background, geography, sexuality or belief. &nbsp;At various points throughout our lives we all feel anger, jealousy, envy, revengeful, scorned, spurned, in love, out of love, unwanted, unappreciated, abused, ambitious, greedy, and so forth. &nbsp;Shakespeare's gift to mankind is that he wrote with dazzling psychological insight about imperfect people subjected to huge pressures in an imperfect world. &nbsp;All other claims about him are, in comparison, full of sound and fury and signifying nothing.</p>

			<p>Second, the view that Shakespeare is merely the product of unfair privilege is aggressively promoted by social justice warriors across the Anglosphere, many of whom are themselves white, rich and privileged. &nbsp;As Shakespeare was a rural grammar-school boy the irony cannot be missed! &nbsp;The essential flaw of the argument, it seems to us, is to judge the realities of pre-16<sup>th</sup> century England through the prism of contemporary preoccupations with diversity. &nbsp;</p>

			<p>In 1999 two-time Oscar winner Glenda Jackson, then an M.P, was <span class="blue">forced to defend Shakespeare in schools <sup>3</sup></span> against those in her own party, the Labour Government of the day, who saw Shakespeare as ripe for eradication from Britain’s national curriculum as he no longer suited their prescription for modern multicult Britain.</p>

			<p>The debate then evolved to how Shakespeare should be taught. &nbsp;In this respect we have some sympathy with those who argued, and continue to argue, that Shakespeare in schools is boring. &nbsp;Where we part company is that we don’t believe this need be so. &nbsp;What has been lacking all too often was, and still is, imagination in teaching it.</p>

			<p>To cut the story short, a consensus quickly emerged that giving ‘kidz’ dumbed down texts was the worst way, while getting children on their feet and speaking it was the best way. &nbsp;In his 2006 book <span class="blue"><i>Beyond Words: How Language Reveals the Way We Live Now</i> <sup>4</sup></span>, British broadcaster John Humphries cites this example of the former:</p>

	<div class="indentedverse">
		<blockquote >
			<pre>
				MACBETH 
				<em>Is this a dagger which I see before me,
				The Handle toward my hand?</em> 
			</pre> 
		</blockquote >
	</div>

		<p>which the alternative text translates as: </p>

	<div class="indentedverse">
		<blockquote >
			<pre>
				<em>Oooh! &nbsp;Would you look at that.</em> 
			</pre> 
		</blockquote >
	</div>		
		<br>

		<p>To this we can add our own depressing example seen in a textbook at an international school in Hong Kong:</p>

	<div class="indentedverse">
		<blockquote >
			<pre>
				DEMETRIUS TO HERMIA	 
				<em>Cor! &nbsp;Go girl, go!</em> 
			</pre> 
		</blockquote >
	</div>
		<br>

		<p>To illustrate the more productive way, <span class="blue">Dr Bethan Marshall, a lecturer in English education at King’s College London <sup>5</sup></span> has argued that it would be better to assess pupils’ Bardic knowledge ‘..through performance’.</p>


		<div class="col-md-12">
			<div class="col-md-9 col-md-offset-1">
			<p><i>I saw a class of 25 at a girls’ grammar school studying <i><u>Hamlet</u></i> who were split into groups of five and had to produce an act in five minutes. &nbsp;The level of engagement was unbelievable. </i></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>This will not appease PC forces that believe Shakespeare is an irredeemable symbol of white male privilege regardless of how he is packaged or taught. &nbsp;Their guns on this issue may have been temporarily silenced, but they not gone away or given up; they are constantly regrouping as the incident this year at Yale bears witness to. </p>

		<br>

		<p><b>Part 2 </b></p>

		<p>The second storm-front takes a different form. &nbsp;<span class="blue">A recent report by the sociolinguistic department of the University of York <sup>6</sup></span> states that, with the great migration of peoples to America and Europe we see today, by 2066 the '[TH]' sound will be lost to London and other high migrant areas so many immigrants cannot manage it. &nbsp;Needless to say by the year 2100 or sooner that would have a devastating, if not fatal, impact on Shakespeare-speaking. &nbsp;In 1603, more or less the pinnacle of Shakespeare’s career, Sir Walter Raleigh was threatened by the Crown prosecutor with the words:</p>

		<p class="text-center">'<i>I thou thee, thou traitor! </i>'</p>

		<p>Difficult though they are sometimes to interpret, the importance of switches between the formal ‘you’ and the informal ‘thou’ forms cannot be overstated in Shakespeare performance. &nbsp;And yet there are opinion-formers on both sides of the Atlantic who feel that, if we must insist on Shakespeare, at the very least it should be re-written to exclude such archaic forms. &nbsp;They are seemingly ignorant of the vital contribution the ‘thou’ form makes to the status games of a Shakespeare plot. &nbsp;What is Shakespeare without such conscious manoeuvrings of status and the unconscious ones of Fortune’s fickle wheel?</p>

		<p>According to the conclusions of the report the best we could hope for by 2100 is '<i>I fou fee, fy traitor</i>'. &nbsp;It is an extraordinary thought that in 100 years perhaps the only counties where actors will still be able to enunciate Shakespeare will be in the barely-English speaking, low inward migration republics of India and the Philippines. &nbsp;Of those two, however, only India has a Shakespeare pedigree.</p>

		<br>
		<br>

		<p>A SHAKESPEARE APPROACH FIT FOR THE 22ND CENTURY</p>

		<p>To push back against these tides of cultural erosion may appear as futile as the efforts of King Canute, but we should at least try. &nbsp;Otherwise our grandchildren, and their children and grandchildren, may be deprived of one the greatest art-forms ever devised in the history of humanity. &nbsp;And it is, of course, Shakespeare’s humanity that above all makes him fit for all mankind. &nbsp;As his rival and friend Ben Jonson put it:</p>

		<p class="text-center"><i>He was not of age, but for all time!</i></p>

		<p>One way to achieve this is to vigorously repackage Shakespeare performance technique in new and imaginative ways that appeal to the Facebook generation. &nbsp;In the TEFL industry (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) the better schools use a range of colourful, interactive, multi-media means to help students speak the language and make it a more enjoyable process. &nbsp;When people enjoy learning they learn faster. &nbsp;Why not the same with the language of Shakespeare? &nbsp;We have made a beginning, but it costs a lot of money. &nbsp;With proper funding we can devise new and better tools. &nbsp;Unfortunately the prospect of help from Arts Council England is poor and dwindling. &nbsp;Its one billion pound annual budget is now only funding <span class="blue">"ethnically diverse projects" <sup>7 & 8</sup></span>.	</p>

		<p>The diversity is not, however, as great as one would be led to believe. &nbsp;<span class="blue">Arts Council England funds the Muslim Festival of Cultures, but does not fund, say, a Christian Festival of Cultures, or a Jewish one <sup>9</sup></span>. &nbsp;Since this is taxpayers’ money and still a predominantly Christian country, dare one ask why? &nbsp;</p>


	<div class="indentedverse">
		<blockquote >
			<pre>
				SCRIVENER
				<em><span style="color:#f0f0f0">....................................</span>Who is so gross
				That cannot see this palpable device?
				Yet who so bold but says he sees it not?</em> 
			</pre> 
		</blockquote >
	</div>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>CONCLUSION</p>


	<div class="indentedverse">
		<blockquote >
			<pre>
				PUCK
				<em>
				If we shadows have offended,
				Think but this and all is mended:</em> 
			</pre> 
		</blockquote >
	</div>


		<p>To avoid causing careless offence to any of the great variety of our readers, we make it abundantly clear that we have no problem at all with completely non-white, or female-only, or gay-only productions of Shakespeare. We’ve seen some in our time and a couple have been quite brilliant.</p>

		<p>By logical extension, nor do we have a problem with mixed race or gender-bending productions – indeed some of the Versebuster squad have been in these themselves.</p>

		<p>If we were casting our own production, our main criteria would be the ability of an actor to handle the verse and the antithetical prose, as well as the strength and clarity of their voice. &nbsp;Gender, sexuality or colour would not come into it. &nbsp;Nor would physical disability unless it placed impossible constraints on the part, or on the production as a whole.</p>

		<p>However, we believe that is a decision for producers and directors only and the government should not impose politically-motivated quotas. &nbsp;Let the theatre-going-public decide by voting their approval or disappointment through ticket-sales. &nbsp;Or is being suggested that, never again, can there ever be an all-white production of Shakespeare? &nbsp;That way tyranny lies – exactly the kind of thing Shakespeare articulated against.</p>
		
		<br><br>
		<p>WHERE VERSEBUSTER STANDS NOW</p>

		<p>After <i><u>Richard III</u></i>, due for release in March 2017, our next two plays are <i><u>Romeo & Juliet</u></i> and <i><u>A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream</u></i>. &nbsp;We would dearly welcome sponsors to help with these two.  Accordingly we are developing the following sponsorship strategy.  It is at concept stage and we are aware it needs considerable refining to give sponsors the confidence to step forward.</p>

		<p>In essence the strategy provides for different tiers of sponsorship to suit different budgets and different ways of helping.  Most sponsorship will be in the form of money, but some would be very welcome in the form of free professional help – accounts, legal matters, copyright, trademark and patents, editorial, etc., etc.  And some in ways we have not yet imagined.</p>

		<p>Here are some examples of the concept (so things are clear, if you haven’t already, please click first on the big orange thingies on the Homepage to view the DEMOs):</p>
