			<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

			<p>If actors and students understand the backstory to Shakespeare’s art they will have a better understanding of the technique involved in verse-speaking and of what Shakespeare was seeking to achieve with the text in general.</p>

			<p>Shakespeare’s art was a culmination of an art-form that began its gestation 2,000 years ago in ancient Greece and Rome. &nbsp;In essence, it is the art of rhetoric;, simply defined as the ability to persuade. &nbsp;We persuade because we make our argument attractive and convincing to hearers. &nbsp;In classical times, rhetoric techniques were honed and developed that politicians and better public-speakers and debaters still use today, consciously or unconsciously.</p>

			<p>In Shakespeare’s early History plays characters try to top each other with their rhetoric, never yielding an inch of ground. &nbsp;Accordingly, as Giles Block observes in <i><u>Speaking the Speech</u></i>, the only way the argument is finally resolved is that one speaker kills the other speaker – it is literally the only way to conclude the argument. &nbsp;</p>

			<p>Conversely, in Shakespeare’s Comedies and late Romance plays people are happy by Act 5 to concede the error of their ways, kiss and make up (though not before sundry banishments, deaths, and other diabolical happenings along the way). </p>

			<p>THE SALIENT FACTS IN AN ATTRACTIVE FORMAT</p>

			<p>As with everything Versebuster does we are putting the key information into an attractive format that gets away from long dry academic articles few actors and students will read.</p>

			<p>We believe a series of short Slide Shows that can be enjoyed for private study or in workshops, drama schools and classrooms with a ‘Get it? Got it!’ quiz after each section is ideal for this purpose. &nbsp;They are designed so that any motivated actor or student over 17 would find them agreeable. &nbsp;However, we hope younger students who are intellectually curious would enjoy them as well.</p>
