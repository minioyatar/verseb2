		    <p class="text-center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

		    <p class="">Our Slide Show explains the rudiments that underpin the <i>e</i>Plays and consequently the Theatre Scripts that flow from them. </p>

		    <p class="">The one here was first drafted three years ago when we had in mind to produce theatre scripts for every play - Modern, First Folio and Quarto (where applicable). &nbsp; Since then it has been decided to merge the First Folio and Quarto into Section D of the <i>e</i>Play where they can be viewed along our modern text. &nbsp; We feel this a more economical and useful tool for actors and directors interested in what original texts have to offer. &nbsp;  </p>

		    <p class="">In addition, the Slide Show Demo was never finished as it became clear top priority must given to developing the <i>e</i>Play format. &nbsp; However, there is still enough in the Slide Show to be of interest. &nbsp; Accordingly, we are leaving it up until we get the chance to overhaul it later this year. &nbsp; We will also produce a short 5 minute version.</p>

		    <p>TEACHING SLIDE SHOWS</p>

			<p>For directors and teachers we have begun preparing a series of slide shows on different aspects of verse-speaking that can be used in drama schools and workshops for different levels of experience. &nbsp; Please check back for a news announcement on this or contact us.</p>
