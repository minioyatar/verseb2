				<li>
					<p>In Elizabethan times English was broadly-speaking a phonetic language, meaning it was written as it was pronounced. &nbsp;Today, due largely to the 'Great Vowel Shift', it is anything but phonetic, as foreigners struggling to learn English will attest. &nbsp;George Bernard Shaw even wrote a humorous poem about it called 'English Pronunciation'.</p> </li>
			</ol>

			<ol start="2">
				<li>
					<p>‘War’ once rhymed with ‘bar’ and ‘scar’. &nbsp;As it no longer does, this can play havoc with rhymes:</p> 
					<div class="indentedverse">
						<blockquote >
							<pre><em>Like of find fault, do as your pleasures are <br>Now good or bad, ‘tis but the chance of war.</em> <br> <br><span class="text-center">(Prologue to <i><span class="branding-style-und">Troilus &amp; Cressida</span></i>, final couplet)</span></pre> 
						</blockquote >
					</div>

					<p>In similar vein, when Shakespeare wrote ‘<span class="branding-style-reg">war-worn coats</span>’ in <span class="branding-style-title">Henry V</span> he heard something rather more muscular than us. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Many words occurring at the end of a verse line ending in '–ion' were pronounced with an extra syllable > ‘Am-BI-ti-ON’. &nbsp;The same is true of '–ious', '-ient' and '-ience' words at the end of verse lines. &nbsp;This made the verse lines scan properly. &nbsp;So what should do we do today? &nbsp; Add an extra syllable which could sound odd to contemporary audiences, or not bother and trip up the metre by being a syllable short? &nbsp; Versebuster helps you decide.<p>
