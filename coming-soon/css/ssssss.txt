I
pray
that
my

love

will

abound
more
and
more
in
real
knowledge

and

all
discernment,
so
that
I

may
approve
the
things
that
are
excellent

-­‐-­‐

and
be
filled

with
the
fruit
of
righteousness
which
comes
thru

Jesus

Christ

-­‐-­‐

in
order
to
be

sincere
and
blame
less
until
the
day
of
Christ,
to
the
glory
and
praise
