			<p>ANARCHY &amp; CREATIVITY</p>

			<p>There is a strand in contemporary thinking that believes 'rules' get in the way of originality 
				and the creative process. &nbsp;In recent times some have tried to do away with the 
				formalities of Shakespeare-speaking, in particular the architecture of verse, in pursuit of 
				rehearsal room spontaneity and 'keeping it real'. &nbsp;In each and every case this has proved 
				disastrous. &nbsp;Actors are unable to unleash the full potential of the text, and audiences 
				are left with Bard-lite and not a little boredom. &nbsp;Peter Hall (co-founder of the Royal 
				Shakespeare Company) and Giles Block (former ‘Master of the Words’ at Shakespeare’s Globe) 
				elaborate on this in their respective books <em>Playing Shakespeare</em> and <em>Speaking the Speech</em> 
				(see <a href="<?php echo SITE_URL_FILE; ?>eplay/bibliography.php">Bibliography</a>).</p>

		      </blockquote>
<!-- END OF CALL OUT -->

			<p>The truth is all great art forms, whether opera, comedy, painting, dance, etc., have parameters and rules. 
				&nbsp; These, in turn, give rise to the technique necessary to master them. &nbsp;The same can be said 
				of sport. &nbsp;Unlike sport though, the rules of engagement in art are hidden from public view, but 
				they are there and actually help the performer - just as they do in sport.</p> 

<p>Take, for instance, Olympic ice-skating. &nbsp;The stage is the rink and you may not skate outside this architectural parameter. &nbsp;You may not wear roller blades instead. &nbsp;You may not fall over without incurring penalties and certain moves are banned. &nbsp;You may not take forever to complete your routine - besides the official time limit the audience will get restless. &nbsp;Yet, despite these 'irksome' rules, Olympic ice-skaters repeatedly find ways to give sublime performances.</p>

<p>Moreover - to continue the analogy - they get marks for technique and marks for creative interpretation. &nbsp;The rub is that you cannot do a great interpretation without great technique - the very point emphasised by the scoring system. &nbsp;It is also true to say that technique alone is unlikely to secure you gold at this level of competition. &nbsp;There has to be some imagination and flair in their somewhere - some creative spark, some personal stamp. &nbsp;But fluid and seamless, not self-indulgent. </p>

			<p>The skill, therefore, is not to ignore the rules or parameters, but to make them second nature so that you 
				transcend them. &nbsp;Pushing against 'walls' produces great art, while anarchy leads to mediocrity.</p>

<br>
			<p>VERSEBUSTER'S 70% RULE - THE 'GET OUT OF JAIL' CARD</p>

			<p>For those who remain allergic to the notion of rules in Shakespeare we offer three comforts.</p> 

			<p>The first is that there is almost no facet of Shakespeare about which experts can be 100% absolutely 
				sure. &nbsp;Unless a personal diary emerges sensationally proven to be written in the Bard's own 
				hand filling the many gaps that still exist in our knowledge of the man and his methods, the best 
				anybody can say is that "such and such in Shakespeare generally holds true" and acknowledge there 
				are occasions it doesn't. &nbsp;For this reason Versebuster has framed two rules with regard to 
				Shakespeare performance - the 'Golden Rule' and the 'Seventy Per Cent Rule'. &nbsp;By far and 
				away most things fall under the Seventy Per Cent (70%) Rule.</p>

			<p>We call it the '70% Rule' because it trips off the tongue better than, say, the '82% Rule', 
				even though that may be nearer the truth. &nbsp;It means that the rule in question works very 
				well somewhere between 65% and 98% of the time. &nbsp;Experience and our guidance will tell you 
				towards which end of this spectrum a given rule leans.</p>

			<p>As to 'Golden Rules' these are rare, but there are a couple. &nbsp;One such is that, as John 
				Barton (RSC) says, you must always identify antitheses in Shakespeare's text and point them 
				up. &nbsp;Arguably this rule trumps any other rule.</p>

<br>
			<p>YOUR PERSONAL STAMP</p>

			<p>The second dollop of comfort is that rules don't negate the personal acting choices which make 
				your performance unique. &nbsp;For instance, a certain rule may say that when such and such is 
				encountered the actor must emphasise it. &nbsp;But HOW you emphasise is up to you. &nbsp;
				Typically one emphasises by increasing volume, but many interesting alternatives exist. &nbsp;
				You could, instead, alter tone, pace, pitch, or switch to sotto or a whisper.</p>

<br>
			<p>AMBIGUITY</p>

			<p>The final comfort that ensures no two performances in Shakespeare will be alike is ambiguity.</P>
						
			<p>When the Hostess recounts the death of Falstaff at the beginning of Act 2:3 in <span class="branding-style-title">Henry V</span> and relates that "<span class="branding-style-reg">he cried out 'God, God, God' three or four times"</span>, what tone does she assume? &nbsp; Is she inferring that Falstaff, in his final moments of senescence, is excitedly greeting God, or that he is in absolute terror of Him for a lifetime of thieving and whoring? &nbsp; Shakespeare provides no answer. &nbsp;So two (or more) perfectly valid, but diametrically opposed interpretations are possible which might substantially alter, if the actor were alive to the possibilities, their delivery of 'God, God, God'.</p> 

			<p>Within a Shakespeare play there might be a run of such ambiguities one scene after another and each time actors have to choose a plausible motivation, because, if not, performance and delivery lose focus and become generalised. &nbsp;Generalisation is theatrical boredom. &nbsp;So you have to commit. &nbsp; And the way you interpret (with or without the help of a director) will not be the same as the actor who played the same role last month. &nbsp;You are unique and this will bring, willy-nilly, a different perspective to the interpretation and a different way of dramatising it - gestures, voice, pace, expression and all. &nbsp; </p>

			<p>Whatever motivations actors commit to in these moments of ambiguity will 'ring true' to the audience so long as they can be justified by the text, and external stuff  (like a director's political agenda or an actor's personal hang-up) does not take precedence.</p>

<br>
			<p>CONCLUSION</p>

			<p>Don't imagine rules will cramp your style and individuality. &nbsp;Within the rules you have 
						creative choices. &nbsp;Trust in Shakespeare's architecture; it's there to help you.</p>

						<li><p>Slide-show 'step-by-step' guides (which can also be projected on walls) illustrate the professional methodology for approaching any text. &nbsp;They demystify and simplify the process by breaking the methodology down into bite-size, digestible sections. &nbsp;Slide-shows range from beginner to advanced. &nbsp; </p></li>

						<li><p>Theatre scripts come in four designs to meet differing acting / teaching needs:  </p></li>


							<ul class="decimal-list">
								<li>
									<p>The standard one is a 'text only' A4 script. &nbsp;This is available for the full play and for individual speeches. &nbsp;It is deliberately plain and has plenty of white space in and around the text for notes. &nbsp;We suggest this is the one actors and students use to mark up their own copy drawing on information in the <i>e</i>Play, the 'preparation' theatre scripts below and the teacher's own guidance. &nbsp;If, over the course of rehearsals / workshops, they make a mess of the script, they simply re-print the relevant pages and tidy up their notes and scoring. &nbsp;</p>
								</li>
								
								<li><p>The first 'preparation script' we offer is for all the main speeches of a play. &nbsp;Presented in a choice of A4 portrait or A3 landscape format, the A4 is principally designed for those that want hard-copy, while the A3 is principally designed for personal study on an electronic device or for group sharing with a projector (though it could be printed out as well). &nbsp;There is (a) a line-by-line verse syllable count together with (b) other useful performance / teaching features, and (c) Versebuster's own observations on the speech. &nbsp;</p></li>
								
								<li><p>Our second type of 'preparation script' focuses on phrasing and places of emphasis using the performance information in the <i>e</i>Play resource. &nbsp;In A4 format, it is available for the full play and for individual speeches. &nbsp;We believe it is particularly useful for beginners or early-stage performance preparation. &nbsp;Though metre and rhythm is of course important (and dealt with line-by-line in the <i>e</i>Play), it helps get beyond, as Ian McKellen would endorse*, iambic sing-song musicality. &nbsp;Nouns, active verbs, interesting adjectives, naturally suspenseful words and caesuras are all scored. &nbsp;<i style="font-size:10px">*Based on lectures he has given (at the time of writing, these are available on YouTube)</i></p></li>
								
								<li><p>Our final 'preparation script' (for individual speeches only), is a verse speech re-formatted as prose to illustrate the performance difference between a 'verse-reading' of verse and a 'prose-reading' of verse. &nbsp;In the earliest plays verse lines are set down in orderly fashion like planks of wood on a slatted house (google the picturesque town of Nantucket, Massachusetts). &nbsp;Therefore, the exercise has greater value when Shakespeare moves away from this 'plank end-stopping' to 'enjambement' (the sense flows over into the next line). &nbsp;It should be noted, however, even <i><u>Richard lll</u></i>, only his fourth play, has enjambed lines - the Bard developed his craft with astonishing speed. </p></li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
					<p>Check out the Theatre Script DEMOs. &nbsp;To compare them side-by-side, you are welcome to download and print. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="tab-pane fade" id="directors">
					<p><i>e</i>PLAYS</p>
					<p>Our superbly annotated <i>e</i>Plays:</p> 
					<ul>
						<li>enable direct line-by-line comparison of our text, lineation, Speech Headers and Stage Directions against that of five well-known editions</li>
						<li>give a syllable count for each verse line</li>
						<li>enable direct comparison our script against the First Folio and a 'Good' Quarto (where applicable)</li>
						<li>graphically identify repetitions (synonyms), antitheses, puns, rhetorical speech builds, etc</li>
						<li>graphically identify interesting switches between 'you' and 'thou'</li>
						<li>graphically identify monosyllabic lines, alliteration, assonance, trochaic feet, etc.</li>
						<li>identify sarcasm, irony, and sexual innuendo</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p>The pdf <i>e</i>Plays are A3 in landscape format. &nbsp;If you want to share with them with your 
						actors the most cost effective way is on a laptop (still very readable especially with the aid of 
						pdf zoom); or, if you have access to a projector, by throwing it onto a wall.</p>

					<p>The <i>e</i>Plays can also be printed off. &nbsp;However, because of the size and the extensive use of colour coding which you’d need to retain, this is expensive (from around $100 to $200 for the longest plays). &nbsp;The cost might be justified for a commercial production where the hard-copy <i>e</i>Play can be shared among the cast as a 'verse-nurse' rehearsal aid.</p>
					<br>
					<p>THEATRE SCRIPTS</p>
					<p>For productions (as opposed to workshops and classrooms) we have a choice of two-full play printable theatre scripts in an A4 format. &nbsp;They both come with Arial size 12 font for easy reading and plenty of white space around the text and between lines for director and / or actor notes. &nbsp;There is a third 'preparation' theatre script just for individual speeches that you may wish to make use of. &nbsp;In more detail:</p>  

<ul class="decimal-list">
				<li><p>The standard A4 script is 'text only'. &nbsp;It is deliberately plain and has plenty of white space in and around the text for notes. &nbsp;We suggest this is the one actors use to mark up their own copy drawing on information in the <i>e</i>Play, the 'preparation' theatre script(s) below and your own guidance. &nbsp;If, over the course of your rehearsals, they make a mess of the script, they simply reprint the relevant pages and tidy up their notes and scoring.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p>The second script we offer uses the information in the <i>e</i>Play resource to focus on phrasing and places of emphasis. &nbsp;We believe it is particularly useful for beginners or early-stage performance preparation. &nbsp;Though metre and rhythm is of course important (and dealt with line-by-line in the <i>e</i>Play), it helps, as Ian McKellen would endorse,  get beyond iambic sing-song musicality. &nbsp;Nouns, active verbs, interesting adjectives, naturally suspenseful words and caesuras are all scored. &nbsp;In addition, there is a line-by-line verse syllable count, together with (a) other useful performance features.</p></li>
				<li><p>The third script a director may wish to make use of focuses solely on the speeches of the play. &nbsp;It has similar notation to (2) above but comes with Versebuster's performance observations on the speech. &nbsp;Please note this script does not mark suggested phrasing and emphasis. &nbsp;This is to help focus on other elements such as line lengths, scansion, elision, false friends, alternative lineations and stage directions, etc. &nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please see Theatre Script DEMOs for samples of the above. &nbsp;You are welcome to download and print to compare them side-by-side. </p>

<p>You will notice that the scripts have a few colour elements for computer / workshop projector use. &nbsp;However, they print very well in B & W. &nbsp;They also print very well double-sided (providing the paper is of decent quality). </p>


					<br>
					<p>AUDIO SPEECHES</p>
					<p>We aim to find all the performance clues in our recordings, which means they are a fairly good guide
					 to the shape and nuance of speeches. &nbsp;If an actor is struggling, to give them a leg up you can exercise your discretion whether to play them our version.</p> 

					<p>We never claim our recordings are definitive but they are competent, even if you don’t happen to like our choices. &nbsp;With your guidance your actors will undoubtedly do a better job!</p>

					<p><span class="branding-style-reg">Which script to use.</span> &nbsp;It comes as a surprise to 
						many people there is no settled and fixed text for many of Shakespeare’s plays. &nbsp;Part 
						of the reason is that virtually nothing survives in the Bard’s own hand. &nbsp;Some argue the First Folio ('F1') of 1623 is the only true performance text, while others prefer an earlier Quarto for some 12 or so of his plays. &nbsp;For instance, for <i><u>Richard lll</u></i>, our inaugural play, expert opinion is divided whether Quarto 1 ('Q1') of 1597 should be deemed the true original performance text, or the F1 version which came seven years after Shakespeare's death in 1616.
						<!-- The most commonly used script though, either through ignorance or choice, 
						is the modern ‘literary’ texts typically used in schools – Pelican, Penguin, Arden, New 
						Cambridge, Oxford, Riverside, etc – even No Fear has its advocates. -->

					<p>The most commonly used script for performance though, either through unawareness or conscious  choice, is the modern ‘literary’ texts devised for schools – Pelican, Penguin, Arden, (New)  Cambridge, (New) Oxford, Signet, etc – even No Fear has its advocates. &nbsp; </p>

					<p>Though we agonised about it for two years we decided in the end to make <span class="branding-style-reg">Versebuster<sup>&copy;</sup></span> modern as well. &nbsp;However, we gear our script to performance needs rather than those of the classroom. &nbsp;This is most evidently manifest in the 'performance punctuation' which, in this respect, glances at the original texts. </p>

					<p>For those interested, Section D our <i>e</i>Play resource sets our modern script side-by-side with First Folio and a Good Quarto (where applicable) for easy comparison. </p>


				</li>
				<li><p><span class="branding-style-reg">Line-endings in verse</span>. &nbsp;Some believe that the end of a verse line whose sense is incomplete nonetheless marks a caesura (a pause); and that this, in turn, invites a breath - or at least a little lift - at the end of the verse line before tumbling into the next. &nbsp;Others believe this is nonsense and, in essence, verse should be read as prose. &nbsp;</p>

				<p>To consider this issue Dr Abigail Rokison-Woodall - now a senior Lecturer at the Shakespeare Institute, Stratford-upon-Avon - wrote a doctoral thesis at Cambridge, later published as <i><u>Shakespeare Verse Speaking</u></i>. &nbsp;We incorporate the findings of her award-winning, critically-acclaimed book into our output.</p>

					<p>In Elizabethan times English was broadly-speaking a phonetic language, meaning it was written 
					as it was pronounced. &nbsp;Today, due largely to the 'Great Vowel Shift', it is anything but phonetic,
					 as foreigners struggling to learn English will attest. &nbsp;George Bernard Shaw even wrote a 
					 humorous poem about it called 'English Pronunciation'.</p>

						<p>‘War’ once rhymed with ‘bar’ and ‘scar’. &nbsp;As it no longer does, this can play havoc 
							with rhymes:</p>

<pre><em>Like of find fault, do as your pleasures are
Now good or bad, ‘tis but the chance of war.</em>

</blockquote >

						<p>In similar vein, when Shakespeare wrote ‘<span class="branding-style-reg">war-worn coats</span>’
						 in <span class="branding-style-title">Henry V</span> he heard something rather more muscular than us.					
					</li>
					<li><p>Many words occurring at the end of a verse line ending in '–ion' were pronounced with an 
						extra syllable > ‘Am-BI-ti-ON’. &nbsp;The same is true of '–ious', '-ient' and '-ience' words at the 
						end of verse lines. &nbsp;This made the verse lines scan properly. &nbsp;So what should do we 
						do today? &nbsp; Add an extra syllable which could sound odd to contemporary audiences, or not bother and 
						trip up the metre by being a syllable short? &nbsp; Versebuster helps you decide.<p></li>
