			<p class="text-center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<br>
			<p>WORLD'S LARGEST RANGE OF THEATRE SCRIPTS</p>
						
		    <p>We provide the world's largest range of Shakespeare theatre scripts, 
		    	covering the First Folio, the Good Quartos and typical modern versions. &nbsp; The theatre 
		    	scripts mirror the text (final edit) of matching ePlays. &nbsp; So the 
		    	<span class="branding-style-title">Hamlet</span> Q2 theatre script 
		    	is an exact match for the edited <span class="branding-style-title">Hamlet</span> Q2 ePlay.</p> 
<br>
		    <p>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A THEATRE SCRIPT AND AN EPLAY</p>

		    <p>For the avoidance of confusion:</p> 
		    <ul>
		    <li><p>Theatre scripts are for company read-throughs, rehearsal rooms and learning lines, 
		    	marking up blocking (when and where to move), personal scoring of the text, etc.</p></li>
		    	
		    <li><p>ePlays - containing detailed annotations (definitions and meanings) and Versebuster's 
		    	proprietary notations (scoring of all performance clues) - are colour formatted pdfs for 
		    	research and study on any digital display device (smartphone, tablet, kindle, laptop, 
		    	desktop or projector).</p></li>
		    </ul>
<br>
		    <p>FULL PLAY THEATRE SCRIPTS OR JUST FOR INDIVIDUAL SPEECHES TOGETHER WITH ANY CUE LINES</p>
		    	 
		    <p>We provide theatre scripts either for the full play or just for individual speeches. &nbsp; A  
		    	unique feature of our speech scripts is that they come, where applicable, with the cue lines 
		    	for that speech. &nbsp; Cue lines, of course, provoke a reply and this feature helps 
		    	actors begin their response in the right key.</p> 

		    <p>Our theatre scripts for speeches are ideal for learning a speech for an audition, or for  
		    	exercises in class or workshop. &nbsp; For working on scenes, simply order the full play 
		    	theatre script.</p>
<br>
		    <p>GENEROUS FONT AND SPACING</p>

			<p>For easy reading and notating at home, in rehearsal or in workshops, our theatre scripts 
				are A4, Ariel, Font size 12 with 1.5 line spacing.</p>
<br>
		    <p>LINE NUMBERING</p>
		    
		    <p>Line numbers in the theatre scripts will correlate exactly with the line numbers 
		    	in the corresponding ePlay. &nbsp; This makes cross-reference easy. &nbsp; (Note that page 
		    	numbers will not be the same owing to different formats.)</p>
<br>
		    <p>INSPIRATION & IDEAS</p>

		    <p>There are many reasons why our theatre scripts are useful.</p>
<br>		    
			<p><strong>Actors</strong> can (while referring to the matching ePlay resource):</p>
			<ul>    
				<li><p>mark up an audition speech</p></li>  
				<li><p>mark up their scenes and blocking for a production</p></li>
				<li><p>reprint pages if they become messy and tidy personal notes.</p></li>
			</ul>
<br>		
			<p><strong>Teachers and drama coaches</strong> can:
			 <ul>    
				<li><p>get students to do exercises on them without spoiling books, the detailed 
			 	annotation and notation of the ePlay serving as the answer sheet. &nbsp;  
			 	For instance:</p></li>
			     <ul>
				 	<li><p>VERBAL CONCEITS. &nbsp; Having explained 'antithesis', teachers could split 
				 	the class into groups to see which team can find the most antitheses in a given 
				 	speech. &nbsp; To flush out themes and obsessions, the same exercise would work with 
				 	repetitions and synonyms (<span class="branding-style-title">Richard II</span> is 
				 	"forerun" with 'woe', 'sadness', 'melancholy', 'grief', 'care', 'sorrow', 'misery', 
				 	'despair' and other synonyms for low spirits and dejection).</p></li>

				 	<li><p>IRREGULAR VERSE LINES. &nbsp; Having explained the performance significance of 
				 	irregular verse lines, teachers could split the class into groups to see 
				 	which team can identify quickest the feminine endings, Alexandrines, short lines, etc.</p></li>

				 	<li><p>RHYTHM. &nbsp; Having explained iambs, trochees and spondees, teachers could...etc., etc.</p>
				 	</li>
			     </ul>
			 </li>
		    </ul>
  
		    <span class="branding-style-reg">Note to teachers:</span>
		    	<ul>
			 		<li>Splitting class into teams saves printing costs</li>
			 		<li>If the school has access to a projector, the ePlay (with all the answers) can 
			 		be thrown on the wall.</li>
		    	</ul>
	<br>	    
			<p><strong>Directors</strong> can:
			    <ul>
				 	<li><p>edit, make cuts or additions, put in added stage directions, do their 
				 	blocking, etc., in preference to scribbles all over a book.</p></li>
				 	<li><p>make a master copy of their edited theatre script for production and cast.</p></li>
			    </ul>
			<br> 
		   	
		   	<p>'PLACE OF EMPHASIS' THEATRE SCRIPTS</p>

			<p>We are considering theatre scripts that bold all the words or syllables in the text we believe 
			should be emphasised or pointed up by the actor. &nbsp; The task would necessarily have a 
			subjective element as sometimes there is more than one valid choice. &nbsp; Therefore it carries risk 
			of controversy. &nbsp; However, if there is sufficient interest we will pursue the idea.</p>
