        <p>NOTE TO KING LEAR</p>
        <p>When King Lear first appeared in a 1608 quarto (now named Quarto 1 or 'Q1') it was titled <span class="branding-style-title">The Historie of King Lear</span>, or, to be exact, <span class="branding-style-title">M.William Shak-speare HIS Historie, of King Lear</span>. &nbsp; When it subsequently appeared in the First Folio of 1632 (F1) it was titled <span class="branding-style-title">The Tragedie of King Lear</span>. &nbsp; It is believed that Shakespeare himself returned to the play to make substantial revisions, an unusual practice for a playwright at the time (the extraordinary conveyor belt of Elizabethan plays had given rise to a 'here-today, gone-tomorrow' shrug towards the art-form). &nbsp; More often it was the company of actors who made revisions, whether to cut running time, insert topical jokes, or otherwise 'improve' it.</p>
        <p>Editors are generally torn between conflating the two King Lear texts or treating them as two distinct entities. &nbsp; As we are a resource we produce editions to reflect the permutations; namely, Q1, F1, and a typical modern conflation of Q1 and F1(the kind most commonly used in schools and productions).</p>
