			<p class="text-center"><strong>THE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE OF ENJAMBING OR END-STOPPING WHEN 
				VERSE-SPEAKING</strong></p>
<br>	
			<p>The last category of scripts - verse speeches set as prose - is designed to demonstrate 
				the aural effect of 'enjambing' Shakespeare's verse; that is, of ignoring the architecture 
				of verse and running lines together where there is no punctuation at the end of a verse line. 
				&nbsp; This makes verse sound more like prose. &nbsp; This is the default position reading 
				Shakespeare aloud in classrooms. &nbsp; Many actors do it too, chiefly as a hangover from 
				the habit acquired at school.</p> 

			<p>The opposite effect is 'end-stopping' which means respecting the verse architecture and 
				pausing at the end of a verse line even when there is no punctuation. &nbsp; Pauses do not  
				have to be big or similar every time. &nbsp; As a rough guide (there are always exceptions in 
				Shakespeare) at the end of a line:</p>
			<ul>	
				<li><p>a full-stop  might invite a big pause </p>
				<li><p>a colon a moderate pause</p>
				<li><p>a semi-colon a moderate or small pause</p>
				<li><p>a comma a small pause</p>
				<li><p>but no punctuation, most interestingly of all, potentially invites any one of these.  
					&nbsp; For more, see <a href="">Blog</a>.</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>A pause is not a blank or a vacuum; the character is thinking aloud, emoting or otherwise 
				dramatising their argument or situation and thereby they create suspense.</p> 

			<p>For vocal control, the end of the line is also an excellent place to breathe - either a 
				snatched breath if the character is in full flow, or a deeper breath just before the
				the climax of their argument. &nbsp; EXAMPLE XXX
				<span class="branding-style-title"></p>
<br>
			<p><span class="branding-style-reg">So enjambing or end-stopping - which is 'correct', 
				which is better?</span></p> 

			<p>The argument rages on. &nbsp; Here is Versebuster's view. &nbsp; Most people only enjamb 
				because they are unaware of the dramatic possibilities of end-stopping. &nbsp; Only the   
				better drama schools and top Shakespeare theatre directors / companies teach it. &nbsp; 
				While it takes a little getting used to, Versebuster strongly encourages actors to develop  
				their end-stopping technique. &nbsp; Having listened to thousands of performances and 
				individual verse speech recordings and live renditions, we can only report that 
				each and every time end-stopping is more dramatically effective. &nbsp; Initially the 
				technique seems counter-intuitive, but it works and we believe that was how it was 
				largely done by Shakespeare's company. &nbsp; Consciously or not, audiences prefer it.</p>
				 
<br>
			<p><span class="branding-style-reg">Can one combine elements of both? </span></p> 
				
			<p>Some like Sir Peter Hall, who is flattered by his reputation "an iambic fundamentalist" and 
			  	a leading proponent of end-stopping, says no, but we feel, yes, you can. &nbsp; But you have 
			  	to know what you're doing. &nbsp; In her award-winning book 
			  	<span class="branding-style-title">Shakespearean Verse Speaking</span> first published in 2009, 
				Abigail Rokison came closer than anyone to date in 'proving' the end-stopping technique 
				has historical validity. &nbsp; However, she concludes that not every verse line has to 
				be done this way. &nbsp; If Rokison believes it's 50/50, we believe it's a classic 
				example of Versebuster's <a href="">70% rule</a>, that is, roughly 70% of the time end-stop,
				30% enjamb. &nbsp; How one picks between the two comes naturally after a while, but we 
				provide a number of specific pointers in our <a href="">Blog</a></p> 

			<p>The whole issue, one of the most bitterly contested in Shakespeare, is one 
				Versebuster addresses extensively through its product range. &nbsp; Moreover, we 
				demonstrate the overall dramatic superiority of the end-stop approach time and again 
				in our audio recordings. &nbsp; Better still, by recording most verse speeches twice
				using both approaches, you can judge for yourself. &nbsp; Hence 'Option 7' above, where 
				verse set as prose invites interesting comparison and vigorous debate.</p>
<br>
			<p><span class="branding-style-reg">Why doesn't Versebuster record <em>every</em> verse speech  
				using both techniques?</span></p>

			<p>The answer is that Shakespeare began his career following the familiar verse format 
				of the time which was end-stopped. 
			
			<p>EXAMPLE XXX.</p> 

			<p>The end of each line has punctuation, whether major (full stop and 
				colons) or minor (semi-colons and commas). &nbsp; <em>De facto</em> these invite a 
				pause, big or small. &nbsp; Accordingly, there is no point in double recording much of
				Shakespeare's early work. &nbsp; It will sound much alike.</p> 

			<p>However, later Shakespeare started to exploit the plodding predictable format of 
				classical verse and jazz it up, much in the same way <a href="">Michael 
				Flatley</a> jazzed up traditional Irish tap and made it a worldwide hit. &nbsp; 
				Thus Shakespeare increasingly moved away from declamatory end-stopped verse toward 
				subtler more syncopated enjambed verse.</p>
			
			<p>EXAMPLE XXX.</p> 
			
			<p>Now it's tempting to imagine that if Shakespeare increasingly <em>wrote</em> in an 
				'enjambment' style, that the actors must follow suit when they <em>speak</em> what he 
				wrote. &nbsp; Understandable, but quite the opposite in fact. &nbsp; End-stopping on 
				verse lines where the sense is not complete creates dramatic tension. &nbsp; That was 
				Shakespeare's intent. &nbsp; Compare these recordings and judge for yourself:</p>  
			
			<p>EXAMPLE XXX.</p>
