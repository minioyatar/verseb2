							    <p>Our basic aim is improve the general standard of Shakespeare performance by empowering students and actors.&nbsp;
							     We harness the digital age to aggregate all the best advice on how to perform Shakespeare and distil it via 
							     a pleasing and intuitive graphical representation that is quick and easy to grasp.&nbsp; To this we add audio.&nbsp; 
							     We hope a curious teenager will find Versebuster as rewarding as a seasoned Shakespearean.</p>

						<li class="read-more-toggle">What's your basic editorial policy?</li>
							<div class="read-more-content">
							    <p>Our basic editorial policy is to present the evidence and let people decide for themselves.&nbsp; Our 
							    product range invites easy comparison between original text and a modern one.&nbsp; Tampering with original texts 
							    is kept to a minimum and any changes are invariably because something is unactable in its original state, 
							    'which' for 'wh?ch' being a famous First Folio example.&nbsp; Such changes are well-signposted and, in
							    any case, reversible in our downoadable Word doc. scripts.</p> 

							    <p>Versebuster has opinions itself and, for better or worse, we share these with the Shakespeare 
							    community.&nbsp; We recognise a certain humility is always in order because nobody have a monoploy 
							    on Shakespeare perception and wisdom.&nbsp; We ourselves learn new things every day and keep an 
							    open mind where this is no obvious right and wrong.&nbsp; Constructive feedback and hearty debate 
							    is strongly encouraged.</p>

			    <p><strong>Why don't you use video for your audio speeches?</strong></p>
			    <p>EXPENSE</p>
			    <p>Expense is one issue.&nbsp; A video needs much more production-time and manpower - lighting, 
			    	wardrobe, make-up, props, etc.&nbsp; We operate on a tiny budget.&nbsp; On the other hand, 
			    	even if we had the money, when it comes to an oral tradition audio serves the purpose better 
			    	than video.&nbsp; Or perhaps we should say an aural tradition, as Elizabethans went to 
			    	'hear a play' not see one.</p>
			    
			    <p>PREJUDICE & PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS</p>

					<p>In addition, seeing faces is a distraction.&nbsp; It's bad enough we have prejudices 
						about voices, let alone our prejudices about how people look.&nbsp; This natural bias 
						that we all have against or in favour of a face is a distraction.&nbsp; Worse, 
						inexperienced actors may feel they have to ape the look, expressions and gestures.&nbsp;  It 
						also puts a preconceived notion into the head about how a character should look.&nbsp; This 
						can cause creative blocks since obviously we could only produce one look per speech. </p>
					
					<p>THE ISSUE OF SCALE</p>
					
					<p>The issue of scale also weighs.&nbsp; As every professional knows, performances have to 
						be scaled to fit the medium and space.&nbsp; Expansive gestures, bold facial expressions 
						and big vocal projection that might be desirable, even necessary, for cavernous theatres 
						and open-air theatre might look or sound ridiculous in intimate spaces.&nbsp; Again this 
						would present a production headache in video that is easier to resolve in audio. </p>
					
					<p>BLOCKING</p>
					
					<p>The one obvious disadvantage of audio is, of course, one cannot illustrate blocking.&nbsp; 
						'Blocking' is a theatre term for an actor's moves and stage business.&nbsp; Shakespeare 
						does indeed choreograph and this is discussed in our<a href="">Blog</a>)</p>
					
					<p>THE FUTURE</p>
					
					<p>In future we may look at animation to illustrate certain visual points.</p>
