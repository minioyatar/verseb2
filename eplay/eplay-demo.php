		    <p class="">The <i>e</i>Play is where we show the key performance performance clues line by line to help you turbo-charge your performance preparation. &nbsp;Like any reference work it is a resource to dip into rather than read cover to cover. &nbsp;</p>

		    <p class="">If you find something interesting in the <i>e</i>Play mark up the corresponding Versebuster theatre script you chose script accordingly. &nbsp;We really don't suggest you mark up everything - so much can be packed into a Shakespeare line, or group of lines, one should only select those elements that interest you most. &nbsp;</p>

			<p><b>INTERACTION BETWEEN OUR THEATRE SCRIPT AND CORRESPONDING <i>e</i>PLAY RESOURCE</b></p>

			<p>For your convenience each page of our full-play theatre scripts exactly corresponds with its counterpart in the the <i>e</i>Play. </p>

			<p><b>BEST VIEWING</b></p>

			
			<p>We also encourage you to make bold use of the ZOOM tool to narrow in on the lines and detail that interest you, or that you wish your students / actors to concentrate on. &nbsp;In workshops we frequently expand to 500% to focus on four to six lines.  &nbsp;Not only can the target lines be clearly seen by those right at the back, it eliminates distraction.</p>
