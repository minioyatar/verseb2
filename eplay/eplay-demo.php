		    <p class="text-center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

		    <p class="">The <i>e</i>Play is where we show the key performance performance clues line by line to help you turbo-charge your performance preparation. &nbsp;Like any reference work it is a resource to dip into rather than read cover to cover. &nbsp;For a hard copy rehearsal script (or a script that can be projected on a wall for group share) please choose from our selection of Theatre Scripts.</p>

		    <p class="">If you find something interesting in the <i>e</i>Play you can mark up your hard copy script accordingly. &nbsp;We really don't suggest you mark up everything - so much is packed into a Shakespeare line or group of lines one can only select the most intriguing elements. &nbsp;Even our <i>e</i>Play (<i><u>Richard lll</u></i> coming shortly will be nearly 900 pages) can't record every literal instance of, say, antithesis. &nbsp;Certainly if we have missed a major antithesis (or any other useful clue) we would love to hear from you. &nbsp;</p>

		    <p class="">We are also still playing around with elements of the design and graphics to bring you the best experience. &nbsp;The <i>e</i>Play format is not bad as it is, but naturally these things can always be improved. &nbsp;The Mark lll <i>e</i>Play will be superior to the Mark l version and so on. </p>

		    <p>Our Slide Show DEMO of the <i>e</i>Play explains the rudiments of verse-speaking on which the <i>e</i>Play is founded, but the physical layout may be explained briefly as follows:</p>

		    <p><b>Section A</b></p>

		    <ol>
		    	<li>A page of text (let's call it 'page 23' of our matching theatre script) is shown in its unelided state to demonstrate the principle of scansion based on the Bible of scansion, George T. Wright's classic work <i>'The Art of Scansion'</i>. &nbsp;We suggest pronunciations based on this. </li><br>
		    	<li>We discuss, cross-referencing with five well-known editions, the substitute words and different lineations of text that are possible,; likewise Speech Headers and Stage Directions.</li><br>
		    	<li>An in-depth depth performance glossary ensures all puns, repetitions, antitheses, ironies, etc., are identified and the actor is aware of subtle changes of meaning from line to line or within a line. </li><br>
		    	<li>Finally, all monosyllabic lines and fully iambic lines are identified.</li>
		    </ol>
		    <br>

		    <p><b>Section B</b></p>

			<p>On the next page of the <i>e</i>Play for the same page of text, i.e. we are still on page 23 of the theatre script, the textual performance clues are isolated (a) to make them clearer, and (b) to serve as a useful teacher tool. </p>

			<p>On the left of Section B are all the repetitions including their synonyms; on the right all the antitheses and words that modify a repeated word or phrase. &nbsp;The text is now fully elided with alternatives indicated in the commentary of Section A.</p>

			<p><b>Section C</b></p>

			<p>On the following page of the <i>e</i>Play, Section C of our imagined 'page 23' devotes itself on the left to clues to do with (changing) status - forms of address, including any interesting switches between 'you' and 'thou'. &nbsp;On the right it identifies potential long vowel sounds (in the context of the passage) and isolates the trochees and spondees. &nbsp;Please note that calling the trochees and spondees is not a perfect science - a point amusingly illustrated in a Prince Charles / Benedict Camberbatch '<i>To be or not to be</i>' sketch at Stratford-upon-Avon to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death (google).</p>

			<p><b>Section D</b></p>

			<p>In Section D we set the modern text alongside an original 'Good' Quarto and the First Folio version where applicable. &nbsp;There is no First Folio version of <i><u>Sir Thomas More</u></i> however, and nor do we have access at this time to an authoritative Quarto of it. &nbsp;Accordingly in our <i>e</i>Play DEMO above you won't find a Section D.</p>
<br>
<br>
			<p><b>INTERACTION BETWEEN OUR THEATRE SCRIPT AND CORRESPONDING <i>e</i>PLAY RESOURCE</b></p>

			<p>For your convenience every page of our theatre scripts exactly correspond with its counterpart in the the <i>e</i>Play. &nbsp;Analysis of that page of script in the <i>e</i>Play is then broken down into four sections labelled Section A, B, C & D (as explained above), each with its own dedicated page. &nbsp;This makes comparing your theatre script with the <i>e</i>Play resource a doddle. &nbsp;Moreover, if you only interested in repetition and synonyms, say, you can go straight to left column of Section B of the corresponding <i>e</i>Play page and skip the rest of the sections for that page. </p>

			<p>Accordingly, a 200 page Versebuster theatre script would have 800 pages of corresponding Versebuster <i>e</i>Play. &nbsp;</p>
<br>
<br>
			<p><b>BEST VIEWING</b></p>

			<p>You are welcome to download the DEMO <i>e</i>Play and other demos for easier viewing. &nbsp;For a smooth read go to VIEW in the top menu and, from the drop-down, click on 'Page Display'. &nbsp;Then click 'Enable Scrolling'.</p>

			<p>We also strongly encourage you to use the ZOOM tool to narrow in on the lines and detail that interest you. &nbsp;(Most Adobe readers have a floating menu bar with a plus or minus sign to enlarge / shrink.) &nbsp;For a workshop this is essential as it helps actors / students to focus on the point in question and not be distracted by elements elsewhere in the ePlay as you talk. </p>
