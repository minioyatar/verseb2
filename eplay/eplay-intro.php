<br>
	<p>CORE FUNCTION</p>
	<p>The core function of Versebuster's PDF <i>e</i>Plays is be an in-depth, performance-centred resource  
	for the actor, director or teacher whether using the First Folio (F1), a Good Quarto or a standard 
	modern text. &nbsp;Through annotation and notation they highlight as many performance clues as can be
	reasonably accommodated in one document. &nbsp;Those clues represent the distillation of knowledge
	about performing Shakespeare to be found in 20-odd self-help books by famous teachers and directors 
	listed in our bibliography.</p> 
	
	<br>
	<p>SECOND FUNCTION</p>
	<p>Their second function is to form the basis for our theatre scripts and audio speeches. &nbsp;Accordingly 
		the <i>e</i>Plays represent the forge and working-house of Versebuster thought. &nbsp;If we go wrong in the 
		audio or theatre script, we always go back to the <i>e</i>Play to see where we went astray or missed something. &nbsp;Thus, bit by bit, our product will evolve and improve over time. &nbsp;Constructive feedback is always
		welcome. &nbsp;</p>

		    <p>ENTIRELY PERFORMANCE-ORIENTED NOTES</p>
		    <p>As Versebuster is focused solely on performance, our annotations and notations are entirely 
		    	performance-oriented - a stark contrast to most modern texts. &nbsp;Their notes  
		    	are predominantly literary as they are designed for schools and academia rather than for stage performance. &nbsp; 
		    	Historically their scholarship has made an invaluable contribution to the understanding of 
		    	intellectual sense (matter), but they fall well short on textual evidence related to mood,  
		    	attitude and sincerity (manner). &nbsp;These are the clues that help actors realise a far  
		    	more layered and nuanced performance; a performance closer to the Shakespeare's subtler  
		    	intentions and what seasoned audiences pay to see. &nbsp;Let's consider this issue in 
		    	more depth.</p>

			
			<p>A search on Google reveals 132 million hits for 'Shakespeare'. &nbsp;Of this, less than 0.0001%  
				is actually about how to lift the words, especially his verse, off the page. &nbsp;A similar  
				pattern can be found in print. &nbsp;Lots of brilliantly clever people have written about   
				Shakespeare, but only a handful have focused on how to bring to life a heavily stylised art 
				form that has its origins in classical Roman and Greek rhetoric.</p>
	
			<p>Thus, Shakespeare plays are treated principally as a literary exercise, not a 
				performance one. &nbsp;Here is a an example taken from <em>Henry IV Pt 1</em>. &nbsp;
				The prose line is:
<br>
			<div class="indentedverse">
				<blockquote>
					For though the camomile the more it is trodden the faster it grows, yet youth the 
					more it is wasted the sooner it wears.
				</blockquote>
			</div>
<br>
			A well-known edition gives the following footnote:
<br>
<br>
			<p class="text-center"><strong>Camomile:</strong> a herb of the <em>aster</em> family
			
			<p>Given the context, knowing Camomile is a herb from the genus <em>aster</em> is a useless piece 
				of acting information. &nbsp;What the edition should point out, but fails to, is that Falstaff's 
				line is classic Shakespearean antithesis:
<br>
			<div class="indentedverse">
				<blockquote>
					For though the CAMOMILE the more it is trodden the faster it GROWS, yet YOUTH the 
					more it is wasted the sooner it WEARS.
				</blockquote>
			</div>
<br>
			<p>As any experienced Shakespearean performer knows, it is the contrast of opposites (camomile v. 
				youth, grows v. wears) and the balancing halves of the sentence that must be pointed up in 
				the delivery, otherwise the audience loses the thread of the argument and possibly interest 
				in the actor. &nbsp;In this example what neither actor nor audience need is a lesson in 
				botany.</p>

<br>
		    <p>ANNOTATIONS ALONG SIDE TEXT - SCROLLING NEUTRALISED</p>
		    <p>Our annotations run along side the text; that way the eye can read and scan much faster. &nbsp;It dispenses with the need to scroll endlessly up and down to find a definition or 
		    	explanation - a common flaw with other attempts at e-annotation.</p>
		    	<p>Example XXX XXX.</p>
<br>
		    <p>A SIMPLE COLOUR-CODE</p>
		    <p>Versebuster annotations are colour-coded. &nbsp;Definitions are <span class="txt-black">black</span>, 
		    	editorial acting points <span class="txt-blue">blue</span>, pronunciation points <span class="txt-pink">pink</span>. &nbsp;Where we need to	distinguish between First Folio and modern, First Folio is <span class="txt-green">green</span> and modern <span class="txt-magenta">magenta</span>. &nbsp;
		    	Quarto is <span class="txt-lightBlue">light blue</span>.  &nbsp;
		    	We found it took people about two minutes to get the idea as the content of the 
		    	annotations evidently reinforce the colour-code and vice-versa.</p> 
		    	<p>Example XXX XXX.</p>
<br>
<br>
		    <p class="text-center"><strong>Versebuster proprietary notations - radical departure (2)</strong></p>
		    
		    <p>INTUITIVE & MEMORABLE</p>
		    <p>Our notations (the graphics) that 'score' the text are designed to be pleasing to the eye, 
		    	easy to grasp and intuitive.</p>  
		    	<p>Example XXX XXX</p>
		    	<br>

		    <p>SAME NOTATIONS ACROSS PRODUCT RANGE</p>
		    <p>All Versebuster publications and products use the same notation system; so once you are familiar with it it's a stroll in the park. &nbsp;Should we get feedback that any of our notations (or annotations) are not clear, we will act swiftly to make amends. &nbsp;So let us know.</p>

		    <p>SYLLABLE COUNT & OTHER USEFUL PERFORMANCE INFO </p>
		    <p>Versebuster ePlays do mundane but necessary tasks such as syllable count for every verse 
		    	line saving the actor or teacher the trouble. &nbsp;It makes it possible to spot the 
		    	feminine endings, Alexandrines and other irregular verse lines at a glance.</p> 

		    <p>There are a further 20 odd things we do that are very useful for performance or 
		    	teaching you won't find in a standard modern text. &nbsp;Check out the table 20 reasons 
		    	to consult a Versebuster ePlay here XXX. &nbsp;</p>

		    <p><strong>Schools and the issue of sexual references</strong></p>
		    
		    <p>Many of Shakespeare's plays are pregnant with sexual references. &nbsp; 
		    	Versebuster annotations are completely frank out about them. &nbsp;Our School 
		    	<i>e</i>Plays, however, omit the sexual explanations and notations in the Adult series.</p>
<br>	    
		    <p><strong>Theatre scripts with each version</strong></p>
		    
		    <p>Each ePlay comes with a choice of theatre scripts that matches the text of the play 
		    	you chose. &nbsp;This unique service can help the great variety of our readers in many 
		    	ways. &nbsp;See <a href="<?php echo SITE_URL_FILE; ?>IS-theatre-scripts-demo">Theatre Scripts</a> for inspiration and ideas.</p>
<br>
		    <p><strong>New Editions</strong></p>
		    
		    <p> New editions are released after taking account 
		    	of feedback. &nbsp;We constantly seek ways to improve the user experience -  
		    	perhaps a graphic could be improved, or an explanation made clearer.</p>
