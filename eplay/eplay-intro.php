		    <p class="text-center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
  
<br>
	<p>CORE FUNCTION</p>
	<p>The core function of Versebuster's pdf ePlays is be an in-depth, performance-centred resource  
	for the actor, director or teacher whether using the First Folio (F1), a Good Quarto or a standard 
	modern text. &nbsp; Through annotation and notation they highlight as many performance clues as can be
	reasonably accommodated in one document. &nbsp; Those clues represent the distillation of knowledge
	about performing Shakespeare to be found in 20-odd self-help books by famous teachers and directors 
	listed in our bibliography.</p> 
	
<br>
	<p>SECOND FUNCTION</p>
	<p>Their second function (First Folio (F1) and Quarto only) is to show relatively unvarnished original scripts 
		(in modern type) so people get an idea of the challenges editors face. &nbsp; It is impossible 
		not to make some changes to an original script so as to make it actable. &nbsp; The on-going debate 
		revolves around how far an editor should go to achieve this. &nbsp; Many feel that until  
		comparatively recently editors were over zealous in making changes. &nbsp; In the latest editions there is a trend 
		back towards a lighter and defter touch, but still this fails to assuage some. &nbsp; As you 
		become familiar with the arguments on both sides, you'll be better able to judge yourself.</p>

<br>
	<p>THIRD FUNCTION</p>
	<p>Their third function (F1 and Quarto only) is to graphically show our 'before and after' changes. &nbsp; 
		Purists will be pleased we keep such changes to a minimum. &nbsp; For instance, a modern script may 
		make up to several thousand changes; our changes are in the low hundreds. &nbsp; In part we do this 
		to magnify the differences with a modern script; it makes comparison more interesting. &nbsp; If 
		you don't like our changes - either because you feel we changed too much or too little - we provide 
		a word.doc theatre script incorporating the ePlay changes which is yours to amend as you see fit.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>FOURTH FUNCTION</p>
	<p>Their fourth function is to form the basis for our theatre scripts and audio speeches. &nbsp; Accordingly 
		the ePlays represent the forge and working-house of Versebuster thought. &nbsp; If we go wrong in the 
		audio or theatre script, we always go back to the ePlay to see where we went astray or missed something. &nbsp; 
		Thus, bit by bit, our product will evolve and improve over time. &nbsp; Constructive feedback is always
		welcome. &nbsp; However, you might want to check FAQs why we cannot, or chose not to do certain  
		things at this time (budget considerations, technical challenges, manpower, etc.).</p>  
	
	<span class="branding-style-reg">NB</span>
	<p>Please note only Versebuster can change the pdf ePlays .&nbsp; You are free, however, to change the 
		accompanying word doc. theatre scripts.</p>

	<h4 class="text-center">PRODUCING OUR EPLAYS - HOW WE ACHIEVE OUR GOALS</h4>
<br>
<br>
	
		    <p class="text-center"><strong>Versebuster annotations - radical departure (1)</strong></p>
		    
		    <p>ENTIRELY PERFORMANCE-ORIENTED NOTES</p>
		    <p>As Versebuster is focused solely on performance, our annotations and notations are entirely 
		    	performance-oriented. &nbsp; This is in stark contrast to most modern texts. &nbsp; Their notes  
		    	are predominantly literary as they are designed for schools and academia rather than for stage performance. &nbsp;  
		    	Historically their scholarship has made an invaluable contribution to the understanding of 
		    	intellectual sense (matter), but they fall well short on textual evidence related to mood,  
		    	attitude and sincerity (manner). &nbsp; These are the clues that help actors realise a far  
		    	more layered and nuanced performance; a performance closer to the Shakespeare's subtler  
		    	intentions and what seasoned audiences pay to see. &nbsp; Let's consider this issue in 
		    	more depth.</p>

			
			<p>A search on Google reveals 30 million hits for 'Shakespeare'. &nbsp; Of this, less than 0.1% 
				is actually about how to lift the words, especially his verse, off the page. &nbsp; A similar  
				pattern can be found in print. &nbsp; Lots of brilliantly clever people have written about   
				Shakespeare, but only a handful have focused on how to bring to life a heavily stylised art 
				form that has its origins in classical Roman and Greek rhetoric.</p>
	
			<p>Thus, as stated, Shakespeare plays are treated principally as a literary exercise, not a 
				performance one. &nbsp; Here is a an example taken from <em>Henry IV Pt 1</em>. &nbsp; 
				The prose line is:
<br>
			<div class="indentedverse">
				<blockquote>
					For though the camomile the more it is trodden the faster it grows, yet youth the 
					more it is wasted the sooner it wears.
				</blockquote>
			</div>
<br>
			Typically the only footnote to this sentence is:
<br>
<br>
			<p class="text-center"><strong>Camomile:</strong> a herb of the <em>aster</em> family
			
			<p>Given the context, knowing Camomile is a herb from the genus <em>aster</em> is a useless piece 
				of acting information. &nbsp; What editions should point out, but fail to, is that Falstaff's 
				line is classic Shakespearean antithesis:
<br>
			<div class="indentedverse">
				<blockquote>
					For though the CAMOMILE the more it is trodden the faster it GROWS, yet YOUTH the 
					more it is wasted the sooner it WEARS.
				</blockquote>
			</div>
<br>
			<p>As any experienced Shakespearean performer knows, it is the contrast of opposites (camomile v. 
				youth, grows v. wears) and the balancing halves of the sentence that must be pointed up in 
				the delivery, otherwise the audience loses the thread of the argument and possibly interest 
				in the actor. &nbsp; In this example what neither actor nor audience need is a lesson in 
				botany.</p>
<br>
		    <p>THOROUGH & COMPREHENSIVE</p>
		    <p>Unlike printed editions Versebuster ePlays have no space limitations, so you won't encounter
		    	 the common problem of definitions that are skipped by the publisher in order to 'fit it all
		    	 on one page'.</p>
<br>
		    <p>ANNOTATIONS ALONG SIDE TEXT - SCROLLING NEUTRALISED</p>
		    <p>Our annotations run along side the text; that way the eye can read and scan much faster. &nbsp; 
		    	It dispenses with the need to scroll endlessly up and down to find a definition or 
		    	explanation - a common flaw with other attempts at e-annotation.</p>
		    	<p>Example XXX XXX.</p>
<br>
		    <p>A SIMPLE COLOUR-CODE</p>
		    <p>Versebuster annotations are colour-coded. &nbsp; Definitions are <span class="txt-black">black</span>, 
		    	editorial acting points <span class="txt-blue">blue</span>, pronunciation points <span class="txt-pink">pink</span>. &nbsp; Where we need to 
		    	distinguish between First Folio and modern, First Folio is <span class="txt-green">green</span> and modern <span class="txt-magenta">magenta</span>. &nbsp;
		    	Quarto is <span class="txt-lightBlue">light blue</span>.  &nbsp;
		    	We found it took people about two minutes to get the idea as the content of the 
		    	annotations evidently reinforce the colour-code and vice-versa.</p> 
		    	<p>Example XXX XXX.</p>
<br>
<br>
		    <p class="text-center"><strong>Versebuster proprietary notations - radical departure (2)</strong></p>
		    
		    <p>INTUITIVE & MEMORABLE</p>
		    <p>Our notations (the graphics) that 'score' the text are designed to be pleasing to the eye, 
		    	easy to grasp and intuitive.</p>  
		    	<p>Example XXX XXX</p>
		    	<br>

		    <p>SAME NOTATIONS ACROSS PRODUCT RANGE</p>
		    <p>All Versebuster publications and products use the same notation system; so once 
		    	you are familiar with it, it's a stroll in the park. &nbsp; Should we get feedback 
		    	that any of our notations (or annotations) could be clearer still, we will act swiftly to 
		    	make amends. &nbsp; So let us know.</p>
<br>
<br>
		    <p class="text-center"><strong>Acting clues - radical departure (3) </strong></p>
		    
		    <p>SYLLABLE COUNT & OTHER USEFUL PERFORMANCE INFO </p>
		    <p>Versebuster ePlays do mundane but necessary tasks such as syllable count for every verse 
		    	line saving the actor or teacher the trouble. &nbsp; It makes it possible to spot the 
		    	feminine endings, Alexandrines and other irregular verse lines at a glance.</p> 

		    <p>There are a further 20 odd things we do that are very useful for performance or 
		    	teaching you won't find in a standard modern text. &nbsp; Check out the table 20 reasons 
		    	to consult a Versebuster ePlay here XXX. &nbsp; (If you want to know why the things 
		    	listed are important for performance, please consult the posts in our <a href="">Blog</a>)</p>
<br>
<br>  
		    <p class="text-center"><strong>Three versions of each play - radical departure (4)</strong></p>
		    
		    <p>CHOICE OF FIRST FOLIO, GOOD QUARTO & MODERN
		    <p>Reflecting the different texts that directors may use in performance, each 
		    	ePlay comes in up to three versions. &nbsp; The different texts are the First 
		    	Folio (F1), a Good Quarto if it exists (such as Q2 for <span class="branding-style-title">
		    	Hamlet</span>) and a modern version. &nbsp; For a modern version we steer a middle 
				ground through Arden, Cambridge, Oxford, Penguin, Pelican, Folger and Riverside.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
		    <p>WHY WE OFFER THREE VERSIONS</p>
		    <p>Savvy Shakespeare actors know there are often dividends to be had from 
		    	comparing one text with another for the same play. &nbsp; This is because all three 
		    	texts are flawed and each has different pros and cons. 
<br>
<br>
		    <p><span class="branding-style-reg">F1 and Quartos</span></p>
		    <p>Broadly, the flaws are printing and textual errors. &nbsp; Examples:</p>
		    <ul>
				<li><p>Performance information might be incomplete or confusing - commonly exits
				 and entrances, other stage directions and line attribution</li>

				<li><p>Bits of text are 'missing' (whether accidental or deliberate cuts)</li>

				<li><p>Bits of text appear to be doggerel (whether real or imagined)</li>

				<li><p>Bits of punctuation appear muddled (whether real or imagined)</li>

				<li><p>Verse is set as prose and vice-versa due to 'printing problems' (whether real or imagined)</p>
			</li> 
			</ul>
<br>			
			<p><span class="branding-style-reg">A modern text</span></p>
			<p>Broadly, the flaws are dubious assumptions by editors (claim various critics). &nbsp; Examples:</p> 
			<ul>
				<li><p>Historically many editors have seen their job in terms of a literary duty 
				not a theatrical one; to serve the reader (often school teachers and their charges) not the 
				actor. &nbsp; Thus, over four centuries, they have amended text and punctuation to 'improve' 
				and clean up Shakespeare for a mass readership. &nbsp; In so doing, the argument runs, 
				important performance clues that would only be understood by actors 'in-the-know' have been 
				scrubbed out. &nbsp; An analogy often cited is that of an old Master painting that has been 
				over-restored, the layers, dirt and subtle hue of the original giving way to a sanitised 
				commercial product.</p>
				
				<li><p>The mental and creative processes of reading and performing are not the same. &nbsp; 
				When we read, our brains prefer short, neat sentences. &nbsp; When emotionally charged or filled  
				with passion, we abandon grammatical neatness. &nbsp; We speak in 'garden-path' sentences 
				that meander and zig-zag, justifying, emphasising, modifying, listing, repeating, accusing, 
				amplifying, exaggerating, mocking and so on. &nbsp; A solitary full stop may only come 
				when we've finally got it all off our chest!</p>

			<p>Now for Shakespeare's characters (as with any good drama) passion and pressure are a 
				permanent state of being. &nbsp; The characters, whatever their social status, combine an 
				Elizabethan love-affair with words with an overwhelming need to express themselves - to 
				muse, philosophise, share, reason, persuade, cajole, defend, criticise, argue, vent or lament. 
				&nbsp; And preferably this is done without the interruptions which full-stops are apt to 
				invite. &nbsp; It is argued that Shakespeare tried to capture the energy and excitement of 
				this verbal effusion through a preference for colons rather than full-stops (periods) and generally more fluid punctuation, and that 
				literary editors, unsuspecting of the theatrical damage, instead replaced these with clunking 
				full-stops to 'help' the reader. &nbsp; But, like obstructions on a runway, they prevent the 
				actor from taking off.</p>     
				
				<li><p>Appalled yet fascinated by personal mess and political chaos, Shakespeare writes about 
				imperfect people in an imperfect world. &nbsp; His characters often succumb to irrationality,
				poor judgement, confusion or madness. &nbsp; It is argued that Shakespeare sought to capture
				such moments by switching from regular 'correct' verse to irregular 'incorrect' verse. &nbsp;
				Literary editors have an instinctive aversion to poetic irregularity, overlooking its dramatic 
				possibilities on stage. &nbsp; Perhaps because they are not actors. &nbsp; 'All must be even
				in our government' is their mantra, and so they set about 'correcting' Shakespeare.</p>
			</li>
		    </ul>
<br>		    
		    <p>This is clumsy summation of a protracted debate so heated experts often come to blows (shouting 
		    	and finger-wagging at seminars is not unknown). &nbsp; We confidently predict it will never 
		    	be resolved, so we must live with the fact that all three texts - F1, Quarto and Modern - have 
		    	their admirers and their critics. &nbsp; But it's not a problem for inquisitive actors, 
		    	teachers and directors who will find extra character and performance information by judicious 
		    	cross-reference. &nbsp; As the old thespian adage goes, 'take the best and leave the rest'.</p>
		
		    <p>By putting all the texts into the same modern-type annotated format, Versebuster makes 
		    	comparison between them affordable and accessible to all.</p>
	    
<br>
	    	<h4 class="text-center">FINAL POINTS</h4>
<br>
<br>
		    <p><strong>Knowing which version to choose</strong></p>
		    
		    <p>If you're a student chose a modern text, because that's what schools and colleges use. &nbsp;  
		    	If you're an actor, your director may use F1, a Good Quarto or a modern edition
		    	 - you may not know until the first read-through, but Versebuster has you covered.  &nbsp;  
		    	 For more, see the post <a href="">A Literary Text v. A Performance Text</a> in our 
		    	 Blog.</p>	    
<br>	    
		    <p><strong>Schools and the issue of sexual references</strong></p>
		    
		    <p>Many of Shakespeare's plays are pregnant with sexual references. &nbsp;  
		    	Versebuster annotations are completely frank out about them. &nbsp; Our School 
		    	ePlays, however, omit the sexual explanations and notations in the Adult series (but retain 
		    	the text itself - unexplained it'll will go over the heads of most teenagers).</p>
<br>	    
		    <p><strong>Theatre scripts with each version</strong></p>
		    
		    <p>Each ePlay comes with theatre scripts that matches the text of the play 
		    	you chose. &nbsp; This unique service can help the great variety of our readers in many 
		    	ways. &nbsp; See <a href="">Theatre Scripts</a> for inspiration and ideas.</p>
<br>
		    <p><strong>Once bought, future editions are free</strong></p>
		    
		    <p>Once you buy an ePlay all future editions of that ePlay are free and arrive 
		    	automatically in your inbox. &nbsp; New editions are released after taking account 
		    	of feedback. &nbsp; We constantly seek ways to improve the user experience -  
		    	perhaps a graphic could be improved, or an explanation made clearer.</p>
<br>
			<p><strong>173 - the total number of Versebuster ePlay options</strong></p>
		    
		    <p>25 out of the 38 Shakespeare plays we cover come in F1 and Modern only. &nbsp; 
		    	<span class="branding-style-title">Pericles</span>, a popular play at the time which 
		    	first appeared in a <em>'manifestly corrupt'</em> 1609 Quarto, comes in "F3" (the Third Folio 
		    	of 1664, second edition) and Modern. &nbsp; A further 11 have Quartos of some merit, so 
		    	they come in F1, Quarto and Modern. &nbsp; <span class="branding-style-title">The Two Noble Kinsmen</span> is based on the 1634 Quarto, 
		    	so it comes in that Quarto and Modern. 

		    <p><span class="branding-style-title">King Lear</span> was a history play in the Good Quarto of 
		    	1608 but in F1 it became a tragedy; it really can be argued they are two different plays. 
		    	&nbsp; Accordingly, to fulfil our function as a resource, we produce a modern version of 
		    	<span class="branding-style-title">The History of King Lear</span> Q1 and ditto 
		    	<span class="branding-style-title">The Tragedy of King Lear</span> F1, as well as the more 
		    	typical modern conflated version. &nbsp; (A conflated text is one that appropriates text from 
		    	different original sources to make one 'better' text, an exercise, though not necessarily
		    	invalid, fraught with its own problems.)</p> 

		    <p>Thus far this makes it possible to choose from a total of 90 ePlays (all with matching 
		    	theatre scripts).</p> 

		    <p>However, as noted above, we offer separate school editions where there are a lot of sexual 
		    	and bawdy allusions that need to be explained for adults. &nbsp; 
		    	<span class="branding-style-title">Julius Caesar</span> and 
		    	<span class="branding-style-title">Richard II</span> are free of such references but most 
		    	others are not, <span class="branding-style-title">Othello</span> being perhaps the most 
		    	extreme. &nbsp; Therefore we anticipate a further 83 editions that are 'school-safe' and 
		    	can be used anywhere in the world. &nbsp; This makes 173 
		    	<span class="branding-style-reg">Versebuster</span> ePlay editions in total to choose from.</p>
