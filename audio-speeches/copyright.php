			<p>THE EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE</p>
			<p>Our recordings are purely for educational purposes. &nbsp;Because of this we do things in recordings that we would not necessarily do in performance, nor that we would wish to.</p>

			<p>For instance, we pronounce 'war' to rhyme with 'scar' as it did in Elizabethan times. &nbsp;This is to remind our listeners Shakespeare heard something different to us today and we need to remain alert to this fact or we miss some telling rhymes (not there just to be pretty).  </p>

			<p>Another example would be words at the end of the line that end in '-ion' or '-ience' or '-ient'.  Frequently this leaves the line a syllable short. &nbsp;It is not known for sure if Elizabethan actors made them two syllables to fill the gap, but we illustrate the point anyway in the recordings. </p>

			<p>For these reasons and more please respect our audio copyright. &nbsp;If for some reason despite these things you would like to use a recording for a production please ask first. &nbsp;Naturally we like to help.</p>

			<p>If you want us to record something specifically for you we'd be happy to oblige if we can - just give us sufficient notice. </p>

			<br>
			<br>

			<p>USE IN WORKSHOPS, ETC</p>
			<p>For the avoidance of doubt you may of course play these recordings in classrooms, seminars, workshops and the like. &nbsp;Naturally you are free to criticise or debate them, but please make the above points clear so our recordings are not taken out of the educational context for which they were intended. </p>

			<p>We also be much obliged if you would mention the source, i.e. <a href="<?php echo SITE_URL_FILE; ?>">versebuster.com</a>. &nbsp;We are obviously dependent on your support and word-of-mouth to advance the project. </p>

			<p>Finally, please feel free to contact us with questions or suggestions. &nbsp;We are here to help. </p>
