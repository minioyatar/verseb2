		    <p class="text-center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
		    
	
		    <p>MODELLED ON iTUNES</p>
		    
		    <p>The database is modelled on iTunes. &nbsp; However, not only can you hear a section of the speech
		     but you can view the relevant portion of the annotated text at the same time (like being able to 
		     read the lyrics and scoring of a song as it plays). &nbsp;  If you're a member, you can also store 
		     speeches in 'favourites' and the information will be saved for future occasions.</p>
	    	<br>
			<p>DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME SPEECH</p>

		    <p>Each audio speech is currently recorded up to three times reflecting possible texts that might 
		    	be used for a performance - the First Folio (F1), a (Good) Quarto or a modern edition. 
		    	
		    <p>With verse speeches we offer an additional recording where the text is reset as prose and performed 
		    	as prose. &nbsp; This offers a vivid means to demonstrate a key difference between prose- and 
		    	verse-speaking. &nbsp; Better still, it allows listeners to make up their mind what works best - to 
		    	observe the architecture of verse or ignore it 
		    	(see post on <a href="">End-stopping v. Enjambment</a> in 
		    	<span class="branding-style-reg">Theatre Scripts for Individual Speeches)
		    	</span>.</p>
		<br>
		    <p>A SCRIPT TO FOLLOW WHILE YOU LISTEN</p>

		    <p>Each speech - as it plays - comes with the source text on your screen. &nbsp; If you want to know why
		    	Versebuster makes the acting choices it does, please refer to the ePlays for our excellent annotations 
		    	(definitions) and our easy-to-follow notations (the 'musical' scoring) that mark the acting clues in
		    	the corresponding text.</p> 

		    <span class="branding-style-reg">Tip</span>
			
			<ul class="decimal-list">
				<li>If you choose a speech from the First Folio (F1) be sure to use the corresponding F1 ePlay 
		    	for explanations. &nbsp; Annotations and notations relevant to one source theatre script (F1, 
		    	Quarto or Modern) may not be relevant to another due to textual and typographical (layout) 
		    	differences between sources. &nbsp;

		    	<li>For the same reason if you download one of our Word.doc scripts be sure it corresponds 
		    	to the audio source text your prefer. &nbsp; Thus if you want '<em>To be or not to be'</em>
		    	audio speech in the F1 version, your corresponding downloads will be the Hamlet F1 ePlay (pdf.) 
		    	that contains the annotations and notations, and the Hamlet F1 theatre script (word doc.)</li>

		    <p>THE VIRTUE OF VERSEBUSTER'S APPROACH</p>

				<ul>
				    <li><p>By being able to hear and see different texts of the same speech, the listener can 
				    	quickly appreciate the dramatic effect that differences in punctuation, in arrangement 
				    	of lines, in word order, etc., have on sense (matter) and manner (attitude and mood). &nbsp; 
				    	In a number of cases the change is startling.</p></li>
				    
				    <li><p>Those unfamiliar with the never-ending debate about whether F1, Quarto or a modern 
				    	text is best for performance get a neat introduction. &nbsp; They need go no further 
				    	than listen to three different versions of Hamlet's '<em>To be or not to be</em>' speech 
				    	to grasp the basics. &nbsp; Illustration, as ever, is worth a thousand words.</p></li>
				    
				    <li><p>The director can get a more tactile feel for which source text they'd prefer.</p></li>
				    
				    <li><p>The teacher / drama coach can utilise the recordings to illustrate all manner of 
				    	things in class or rehearsal.</p></li>
				    
				    <li><p>Despite any personal preference actors may have (if they have any), actors often don't 
				    	know until the first day of rehearsal what text they will be given to use (unless 
				    	working for a theatre company that is known to use F1 only , etc.). &nbsp; By making recordings 
				    	in all three versions (where valid) Versebuster covers most eventualities. &nbsp; Be aware a 
				    	number of famous speeches (and scenes) don't appear in F1; many were probably cut to reduce 
				    	a play's running time.</p></li>
				</ul>
				<span class="branding-style-reg">NB</span>
				<p>If there is next to no difference between source texts, we just record based on F1. &nbsp; 
					So some verse speeches will come in two versions only (F1 and F1 reset as prose), some in four 
					(F1 & Modern and then again reset as prose), some in six (F1, Good Quarto and Modern and then 
					all again reset as prose). &nbsp; In the case of Hamlet's '<em>To be or not to be</em>' speech 
					we also do the Bad Quarto version from Q1 as it always amuses students and audiences alike 
					(as well as making an important point about original texts).</p>

				<p>Be aware there are speeches that are set as prose in F1 but as verse in Quarto or Modern. &nbsp;
					Naturally we do all versions.</p>

				<p>We record many great prose speeches as well.</p>
