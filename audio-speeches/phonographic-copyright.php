			<p>VERSE-NURSE TEACHING PURPOSE ONLY</p>

			<p><b>Productions</b></p>

			<p>As we discuss in <a href="<?php echo SITE_URL_FILE; ?>audio-speeches/recording-notes">Recording Notes</a> our recordings are purely for verse-nurse teaching purposes. &nbsp;Consequently we seriously doubt they have any value production-wise. &nbsp;If for some reason despite this you would like to use a recording for a production please observe the usual courtesies and ask first. &nbsp;Naturally we like to help. &nbsp;For a small actor profit-share production we only ask for an AD in the programme (program). &nbsp;For commercial productions, a modest fee + an AD in the programme (program).</p>

			<p>If you want us to record something specifically to your requirements, we'd be happy to oblige if we can - just give us sufficient notice.</p>

			<p><b>YouTube</b></p>

			<p>We'd rather you didn't stick it on YouTube. &nbsp;But if you feel compelled, please acknowledge where you got it from (<a href="<?php echo SITE_URL_FILE; ?>index">versebuster.com</a>) and add our <a href="<?php echo SITE_URL_FILE; ?>audio-speeches/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a> to the description field.</p>

			<br>

			<p>USE IN WORKSHOPS, ETC</p>

			<p>For the avoidance of doubt you may of course play these recordings in classrooms, seminars, workshops and the like - that is the idea! &nbsp;Naturally you are free to criticise and debate them, but please preface with our <a href="<?php echo SITE_URL_FILE; ?>audio-speeches/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a>.</p>

			<p>We also be much obliged if you would mention the source (<a href="<?php echo SITE_URL_FILE; ?>index">versebuster.com</a>). &nbsp;We are obviously dependent on your support and word-of-mouth to advance the project.</p>
			<br>
			<p>QUESTIONS & SUGGESTIONS</p>

			<p>Finally, please feel free to contact us with questions or suggestions. &nbsp;We are here to help.</p>
