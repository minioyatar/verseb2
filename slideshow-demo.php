		    <p class="text-center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

		    <p class="">Our Slide Show explains the rudiments of verse-speaking that underpin the <i>e</i>Plays and, consequently, the Theatre Scripts that flow from them. </p>

		    <p class="">The Slide Show here was first drafted three years ago when we had in mind to produce theatre scripts for every play in three versions - Modern, First Folio and Quarto (where applicable). &nbsp;Since then it has been decided to merge the First Folio and Quarto (where applicable) into Section D of the <i>e</i>Play where they can be viewed right alongside along our modern text. &nbsp;We feel this is a more economical tool for actors and directors interested in what the original texts have to offer. &nbsp; </p>

		    <p class="">In addition, the Slide Show was never finished as it became clear priority must given to developing the <i>e</i>Play format. &nbsp;However, there is still enough in the Slide Show to be of interest. &nbsp;Accordingly, we are leaving it up until we get the chance to overhaul it later this year. &nbsp;We will also produce a short 5-7 minute version.</p>

		    <p>TEACHING SLIDE SHOWS</p>

			<p>For directors and teachers we have begun preparing a series of slide shows on different aspects of verse-speaking that can be used in drama schools and workshops for different levels of experience. &nbsp;Please check back for a news announcement on this or contact us.</p>
